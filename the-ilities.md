## -ilities to business concerns
Referencing: Mark Richards. [Software Architecture Monday, Lesson 37 - Translating Quality Attributes to Business Concerns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP9Q9dpTomA)

### Non-functional Quality Attributes (aka architectural characteristics)
- adaptability - 
- agility - how quickly we can change to adapt to market needs / the ability respond quicklly to change
- availability - doesnt go down often
- deployability - low risk of breaking something on deployment, how fast or frequently we can deploy new features
- extensibility - api layers and open systems
- fault-tolerance - system keeps working even in face of failure
- interoperability - can interopt with mergers and acquisitions (standards based)
- learnability - simplicity, documentation to make system learnable
- modularity
- performance - faster applications
- recoverability
- scalability - can we scale our systems to support higher loads, or scale down to save costs
- security
- testability - ease of testing, completeness of testing, reduces bugs

### Business Concerns
- user-satistfaction -> performance -> availability -> fault tolerance -> testability -> agility
- time-to market -> agility -> testablity -> deployability
- competitive advantage -> agility -> testability -> deployability -> scalability -> availability -> fault tolerance -> adaptabilty
- regulatory compliance
- mergers and acquisitions -> agility -> scalability -> learnability -> interoperability -> extensibility -> adaptability

### abbreviations: s/u: system or unit
- accessibility: designed to be accessible to those with disabilities
- accountability: commitment and transparency.  Accountability for my performance, the team, fair assessments of team, quality of shared codebase
- accuracy: how accurate are values
- adaptability: measures the amount of changes needed for adaption of software to different specified environments.
- administrability: how easy is it to administer the system
- affordability: how affordable is the system to put into prod. and run
- agility:  how quickly can it adapt to business challenges in changing envs
- auditability: how easily and thoroughly can the system be examined by outsiders
- autonomy:  can the system work by itseld
- availability: how reliably availble is the system
- compatibility: 
- composability:  
- configurability: 
- correctness: 
- credibility: 
- customizability: 
- debuggability: 
- degradability: 
- determinability: 
- demonstrability:

- efficiency: 
- evolvability: 
- extensibility: 
- failure transparency: 
- fault-tolerance: 
- fidelity: 
- flexibility: 
- inspectability: 
- installability: Measures the amount of effort needed to install the s/u into a specified environment.
- integrity: 
- interchangeability: 
- interoperability:  How well software interacts with specified systems
- learnability: Measures how well users can learn to use the software
- localizability: 
- maintainability: How brittle is the s/u to change?
- manageability: 
- mobility: 
- modifiability: 
- modularity: 
- observability: Provides ability to ask questions about env without knowing ahead of time what you want to ask.  Ask any arbitrary question and a s/u is observable to the extent you can answer it from observing without new instrumentation
- operability: Measures how well or efficiently users can operate the system
- orthogonality: 
- portability: 
- precision: 
- predictability: 
- process capabilities: 
- producibility: 
- provability: 
- recoverability: Measures how well a s/u recovers from software faults or s/u failures
- relevance: 
- reliability: 
- repeatability: 
- reproducibility: 
- resilience: 
- responsiveness: 
- reusability:  
- robustness: 
- safety: 
- scalability: How well does the s/u handle increased demand or stress
- seamlessness: 
- self-sustainability: 
- serviceability (a.k.a. supportability): 
- securability:  
- simplicity: 
- stability: How resistant is the system to unexpected effects as a result of modifications?
- standards compliance: 
- survivability: 
- sustainability: 
- tailorability: 
- testability: How much effort is needed to validate the software and provide test coverage?
- timeliness: 
- traceability: 
- transparency: 
- ubiquity: 
- understandability: A system should be documented and organized in a way that an engineer can easily comprehend and reason about it.  A s/u is understandable if it is: complete, concise, clear and organized.
- upgradability: Capability of being improved in functionality by addition or replacement of components
- usability: capacity of s/u to perform quantified objectives with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a quantified context of use
- vulnerability: ability of a s/u to withstand effects of hostile environment
